    **Harf** has the ability to choose his own class at a _[station]_, and his
    stats will change to accomodate the class. Thenever he unlocks an
    untimate, he gains the ability to have another class the he is able to
    switch to in battle, and can eventually switch between all four. **Harf** can
    only use class specific abilities whenever he is that class, but an
    effects gained from class specific abilities such as buffs or heals will
    not be lost. Switching classes in battle will change his health immediately
    but will not affect any other stats until the next round.
