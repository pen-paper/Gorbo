Le Game
=======

This is a game created by Christian Dhainin, with help from Jackson Dill, Ethan Bowen, John Hiatt, and others that I am not currently aware of. 

Running the Game
----------------

### Dependencies

* Python 3.7
* Pyglet 1.3

This cannot be run from the root directory using 
```python gorbo.py```
because it is being updated and has not been fixed yet.

A test version can be run from the `src` directory using
```python test.py```
